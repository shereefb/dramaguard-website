People-over twenty years, we've walked into boardrooms and bullpens from Silicon Valley to New York finance, and before we even sit down we feel it: the low hum of drama. Not the soap-opera version-it's subtler. It's the project manager who answers every ask with sure, I'll handle it and then resents everyone silently. It's the engineer who won't speak up until someone's scapegoated. It's the weekly retro that lasts ninety minutes because no one's sure whose call it was to ship. And after thousands of hours listening, we've learned drama isn't random-it's engineered by two invisible forces nobody talks about. First: personal power leaks. We all want agency-to matter, to matter. But when we're afraid we'll be ignored or attacked, we don't say this is what I need; we slide into the Karpman Drama Triangle instead. Victim mode: They'll never let me do what's right. Hero: Watch, I'll pull eighteen-hour days so no one calls me out. Villain: Fine-if that's how it's gonna be, I'll make them pay. Each time you flip roles you invite the next person to play theirs; suddenly everyone's exhausted but nobody's actually deciding anything. Second: structural fog. An org chart looks clear on paper, but day-to-day? Is marketing allowed to override engineering on deadlines? Does ops really sign the budget, or is it whoever yells loudest? Without explicit clarity, power becomes currency: people whisper, align against instead of with, hoard info to stay safe. Decisions drag. Morale corrodes. And the cost isn't abstract-it's flight risk, it's delayed launches, it's money flushed on meetings that end well, we'll circle back. Here's how we end it: start inside. Drop the triangle. Speak from presence-Here's my stake, here's what I need-no rescuing, no attacking. Then get surgical with structure: name the decision-maker once, in writing, visible to all. Not bureaucracy-clarity. Roles lock. Drama starves. That's the Empowerment Triangle: personal power up top, clear org structure below it, and everything flows. The people piece didn't invent this-we refined it. But software makes it stick, so we built DramaGuard. You install it in Slack like any app. Day one it reads your history-no judgment, just patterns: here's where Victim talk spikes around performance reviews, here's where Hero threads turn into blame marathons. We bundle that intel into a half-day workshop-real Slack screenshots on the wall, live coaching, everyone leaves with their own drama fingerprint and three moves to shut it down. Then DramaGuard turns into your pocket therapist: as you're typing ugh why are we always doing it this way?, before you hit send it offers, Try: what's the next step I'd like to own? Private. Gentle. And once a month we reconnect-us, you, maybe ten minutes reviewing the heatmap, twenty celebrating how many times someone caught themselves mid-victim and rewrote. It's not about perfect-it's about momentum. Drama thrives in silence; clarity starves it. Twenty years says we're not guessing. This works.
